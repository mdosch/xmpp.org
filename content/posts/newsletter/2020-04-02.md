## Articles

_Everyone participating, please just don't drop links rather try to make a short and decent formulated description what is the main outcome of your source. This will help us a lot! You don't need to write formal, be passionately why this motivates you!_

[Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), maintainer of libstrophe and contributor to profanity, wrote about using the [XML console in profanity](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/xml-console-in-profanity/) for debugging.



Jan Cie≈õla from MongooseIM wrote a blog post how [they thrive their project by the metrics](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/how-data-drives-mongooseim.html).

[Kaidan 0.5.0](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/04/06/kaidan-0.5.0/) - Bam! Check out their new onboarding!

Lets say it like this: Removing OTR + Rework conference and contact details + show PDF previews + title for audio files = [Pix-Art Messenger 2.3.5](https://github.com/kriztan/Pix-Art-Messenger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Four letters for Windows Users: [UWPX 0.25.0](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.25.0.0) is online with Windows10X support (what ever that Windows 10 is) and a push server. So give it a try!

Monal continues on fighting the iOS front: From the [beta](https://monal.im/blog/4-6-betas/) upcoming are support for geo location messages and TLS ALPN support as well as many fixes with smack.


### Servers




### Clients and applications

The maintainer of libstrophe, [Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), and contributor to Profanity, created a tool called [xmppconsole](https://github.com/pasis/xmppconsole) which sends raw XMPP stanzas over an XMPP connection and displays the XMPP stream. Main purpose is to study XEPs and debug servers implementation.
The tool is under development, the finished version will support both GTK UI and ncurses UI. In the blog they also explained how to easier contribute commits to their repository, [read on](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/contributing-a-patch-via-github/)!
